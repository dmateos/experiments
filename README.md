# Reticulated 

Basic 2D/3D engine in python using OpenGL. 

No way intended to be a complete implementation, just a wrapper around standard features i use. 

General:
  - OO Wrapper around standard OpenGL functions
  - Pythonic API for access to VertexBuffers and similar
  - GLFW Screen and context setup
  - Framebuffer wrappers 
  
2D:
  - Sprites 
  - Instanced sprite rendering 
  - Texturing 
  - Transforms 
  - Orthagonal view with a 0,0 top/left based coordinate system 
  
3D: 
  - Obj model loading 
  - Instanced based rendering of the same model
  - Per model shadder program support 
  - Basic Camera
